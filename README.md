WebApp Group Project

CS378 Project Rick Rauschke, Joshua Ward, Jaime Williams

The movie diary is a simple web app to allow a loggedin user
to add/view/edit/delete movies from a personal database.  The
user also has the ability to import movies from themoviedb.org.

VERSION:
1.0 - initial release for debugging and testing

ISSUES:
- will create a mostly empty record with no title
- relies on mysqlnd (native driver) for get_result call
  this is not functioning on at least bluehost but 
  works locally on wamp for instance (with mysqlnd).
